# CodeHer Hackathon

This project was made for WECS' CodeHer+ Hack-a-thon by [Franklin](https://github.com/FranklinJiaChen) and [Ana](https://github.com/fluffyponyy).

The hackathon took place at Sunday, October 6th, 2024.

We were allocated 4.5 hours to code up the project with the following prompt.

"This competition is to create a personal finance management platform. This can be in the form of an app,
website, or otherwise accessible platform. The goal is for your designs to be used by university students to
manage their finances."

We achieved 2nd out of 8 teams.
